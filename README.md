# BusMall

## Overview
This is my week 3 project for Bootcamp 1 at Alchemy Code Lab. I'm building this application to learn more about HTML, CSS, & javaScript.

This is a site for BusMall, a fictional magazine similar to SkyMall. On this site you can take a poll to vote for your favorite products. On the settings side of the site you can update the options of the poll. 

## Getting Started
Press the 'Take Poll' button and choose which products you like best. Want to change the settings on the poll click the 'Settings' button and fill out the form.
